Guava is a set of core libraries that includes new collection types (such as multimap and multiset), immutable collections, a graph library, functional types, an in-memory cache, and APIs/utilities for concurrency, I/O, hashing, primitives, reflection, string processing, and much more!

Guava comes in two flavors.

The JRE flavor requires JDK 1.8 or higher.
If you need support for JDK 1.7 or Android, use the Android flavor. You can find the Android Guava source in the android directory.
